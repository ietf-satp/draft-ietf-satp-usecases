1.  Introduction

   Business networks, built on both centralized and decentralized
   models, have emerged to manage cross-organization assets and
   workflows.  The scope of such workflows and the assets they govern,
   as well as the set of participating organizations within a network,
   have been quite limited, partly for security, privacy, and
   scalability reasons, and partly because organizations have been
   reticent to moving large portions of their pre existing workflows to
   such networks.  We see this especially in the areas of trade,
   finance, supply chain logistics, and property management.  Yet the
   workflows managed by these networks are naturally interlinked in the
   real world, and therefore cannot afford to remain isolated from each
   other technologically, which would diminish the value of their
   assets.  At the same time, a network, once built, has institutional
   staying power, and it is therefore impractical to assume that they
   will expand or merge.  Interoperability is therefore an imperative in
   this fragmented business network ecosystem.  This comes in different
   flavors, namely the ability to move an asset from one network to
   another, interlinking workflows to share asset state with proof of
   authenticity from one network to another, and swapping assets in
   different networks as part of a business transaction, as listed in
   the SAT Architecture Specification [SATA].  The purpose of this
   document is to describe prominent examples of these modes that have
   been encountered by enterprises and business consortiums and
   identified as challenges to be overcome.  In particular, this
   document describes scenarios where the Secure Asset Transfer Protocol
   (SATP) [SATP] can be directly applied to solve the problem of moving
   digital assets across networks, for which no other canonical protocol
   exists in the literature.

2.  Terminology

   The following are some terminology used in the current document.  We
   borrow terminology from [NIST] and [ISO] as much as possible,
   introducing new terms only when needed:

   *  Asset network (system): The network or system where a digital
      asset is utilized.

   *  Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP): The protocol used to
      transfer (move) a digital asset from one network to another using
      gateways.

   *  Origin network: The current network where the digital asset is
      located.

   *  Destination network: The network to which a digital asset is to be
      transferred.

   *  Data sharing: The process, using the Asset Transfer Protocol, by
      which one or more units of verifiably authentic data are
      communicated from an Origin network to a Destination network,
      either voluntarily or upon request.

   *  Asset Transfer: A fail-safe process of moving an asset from one
      network to another, with the destruction of the asset in the
      Origin network and its recreation in the Destination network
      occurring as a single atomic action.

   *  Asset Exchange: A fail-safe process of exchanging (or swapping)
      assets held by a pair of owners, each asset being maintained in a
      different network, with the two in-network transfers occurring as
      a single atomic action.

3.  International Trade and Supply Chains

3.1.  Trade Finance and Logistics

   There are several real-world examples of consortium networks managing
   different aspects of international trade.  Networks like We.Trade
   [WET], built on Hyperledger Fabric [HLF], and Marco Polo [MP], built
   on R3 Corda [R3C], manage trade finance workflows by connecting
   exporters, importers, and financial institutions (primarily banks).
   Other networks like TradeLens [TL], built on Hyperledger Fabric,
   manage trade shipping and documentation logistics, by connecting
   exporters and shipping carriers.  As an example, consider a system of
   two networks as illustrated in Figure 1: (a) a trade finance network
   managing letters of credit business lifecycles from application to
   fulfilment, and (b) a trade logistics network managing shipping
   consignment creation and dispatch documents like bills of lading.

   An exporter who belongs to both systems must produce a valid bill of
   lading in the trade finance network to enforce a payment from the
   buyer to fulfil the terms of the letter of credit.  But this bill,
   which serves as evidence of a shipping consignment’s dispatch via a
   carrier, lies in the other, i.e., trade logistics, network.  The two
   networks must therefore be interoperable in such a way that the
   logistics network can share a bill with the finance network along
   with independently verifiable proof of authenticity.  Otherwise, the
   trade finance network’s workflow must trust that the exporter is
   acting in good faith and supplying genuine bills of lading, which
   adds insecurity.  This interoperation, which involves sharing of
   network data, can be extrapolated to other scenarios involving the
   two networks.  The trade logistics network can require an exporter to
   produce a valid letter of credit from the trade finance network
   before permitting a consignment record creation.  Both these cross-
   network data sharing instances are illustrated in Figure 2.

                               Figure 2

   Asset transfers among trade networks: In the preceding example,
   letters of credit and bills of lading represent portions of state of
   the larger export-import workflow.  But these documents are also
   digital assets in their own rights.

   A bill of lading can serve as title to the consignment of goods being
   shipped, and hence can be traded as a security or used as collateral
   against debt obligations in the financial market.  Hence, Step 11 in
   Figure 2 may well be embodied by the transfer rather than the sharing
   of state of a bill so that it ceases to remain on the Trade Logistics
   Network ledger and instead belongs to the Seller’s Bank on the Trade
   Finance Network’s ledger.

   A letter of credit may also assume the properties of a digital asset
   in certain situations.  Consider the case of an importer who wishes
   to move their business to a different trade finance network and
   maintain their records on that network’s ledger.  We can assume that
   the banks and the exporter participate in the second trade finance
   network as well, which exists to serve a different clientele.  The
   importer needs to be able to move its letter of credit state to the
   other network and resume the trade workflow after migration.  This
   requires the ability to transfer the letter in the form of a digital
   asset from one trade finance network to another.

3.2.  Tracking Food Shipments

   The use case linking a trade finance network with a trade logistics
   network can be augmented by adding a food tracking network like the
   IBM Food Trust [IFT] to the mix.  Such a network connects producers,
   suppliers, manufactures, and retailers, who participate in food
   supply chains.  Purchase orders, like those negotiated between
   producers and retailers, and which are illustrated as negotiated
   between exporter and importers in Figure 2, are recorded in this
   network’s ledger.  For quality control, its business workflow will
   track at periodic intervals the state (e.g., temperature and
   humidity) of containers carrying, for example, produce from farm to
   source port and from destination port to warehouse.  The trade
   logistics network handles documentation and dispatch but does not
   track the location or condition of a consignment outside of a
   carrier’s purview.  Clearly, these networks play complementary roles
   in a supply chain.  The logistics network should be able to get the
   state and history of a container before dispatch from the food
   tracking network, as should the latter from the former after the
   carrier has delivered a consignment.  End-to-end supply chain
   visibility and effectiveness relies on the interoperability of these
   two networks, or to be precise, their ability to share verifiably
   authentic data with each other.  Further, such interoperation also
   enables the trade finance network to allow the creation of a letter
   of credit only after verifying the existence of a valid purchase
   order in the food tracking network.  Figure 3 illustrates the links
   between these networks.

3.3.  Supply Chain Management

   To complete the picture, we can add a payment network to the mix,
   which maintains currency accounts for clients in different countries
   and enables cross-border payments, an example being the Stellar
   network [STN].  After goods have been dispatched, and optionally
   after verification of the delivery and proper condition of a
   shipment, payment is due from an importer to an exporter.  The trade
   finance network can record a payment obligation on its ledger but it
   will rely on the payment network to process and confirm the actual
   transfer of funds.  The former shares data about the obligation to
   the latter, which shares data about a successful (or otherwise)
   payment in return, as illustrated in Figure 4.

                               Figure 4

   Addendum: we can add yet another network to the mix, one that manages
   regulatory compliance.  (E.g., proof-of-concept systems have been
   built to bring banks and corporations on a single distributed ledger
   and smart contract platform to share KYC information in privacy-
   preserving ways [BKYC] [SKYC].)  Now issuances of letters of credit
   in the trade finance system will be dependent on valid KYC records
   being maintained as assets in the regulatory compliance system.

4.  Currency and Finance

   The emerging paradigm of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and the
   emerging application of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) have
   opened up a spectrum of scenarios that require management of
   financial digital assets across multiple systems, typically built on
   distributed ledgers.

   DeFi is a “new financial paradigm that leverages distributed ledger
   technologies to offer services such as lending, investing, or
   exchanging cryptoassets without relying on a traditional centralized
   intermediary” [BISDeFi].  Following the Web3 philosophy [Web3],
   scoped for the world of finance, DeFi offers architecture and
   protocols built on smart contracts deployed on blockchain or other
   distributed ledger technology.  It thereby obviates the need for
   centralized management and orchestration of financial processes
   (e.g., currency transfers, exchanges, securities settlements) by
   trusted authorities who can gain undue leverage.

   CBDC is a form of tokenized cryptocurrency that various central banks
   around the world are experimenting with as the digital equivalent of
   traditional central bank-issued money used by banks and other
   financial institutions as well as end users for commercial
   transactions and settlements.  Central banks possess exclusive
   authority to mint and issue money in physical cash form and in the
   form of electronic reserves.  They also support commercial bank money
   used in retail transactions by banks and other users in their private
   capacities.  Central banks have traditionally used their control over
   these different forms of money to enforce monetary policy in a way
   that promotes financial stability and provides broad access to safe
   and efficient payments [BISCBDC].  CBDCs would form a new, or
   alternative, type of central bank money, typically (but not always)
   built on blockchain or other distributed ledger technology.  They
   have recently garnered significant interest in government circles by
   promising increased access and inclusion, better resilience, and
   increased scale and efficiency of currency transfers, compared to
   traditional forms of central bank-issued or central bank-backed
   currency.

   CBDCs can broadly be classified into “wholesale” and “retail”.
   Wholesale CBDC, which facilitates inter-bank and cross-border
   settlements, is currency that is available only to banks and other
   financial institutions.  Retail CBDC is available to the public and
   can be used as a digital form of cash, enabling fast transparent
   payments for goods and services at high scale and volume; in effect,
   it can be used as a substitute for legacy payment mechanisms.

   Different system architectures exist to manage CBDC for banks and end
   users, from issuance to transfers to redemptions.  A 2-tier model as
   illustrated in Figure 5 has recently gained popularity, where
   wholesale CBDC networks manage interactions between central and
   commercial banks, and retail CBDC networks manage interactions
   between commercial banks and end users.  If we consider the role of
   the central bank as the defining characteristic of a system
   architecture, this model can be referred to as “indirect”, because
   commercial banks mediate claims between the central bank and end
   users and also facilitate payments.  Other architectures also exist,
   including “direct CBDC”, where the central bank issues CBDC directly
   to end users and facilitates payments, and “hybrid CBDC”, which
   provides users the facility to make direct claims on the central bank
   while allowing intermediaries to facilitate payments [BISRCBDC].

4.1.  Currency Transfers

   The 2-tier “indirect CBDC” model illustrated in Figure 5 presents
   unique interoperability challenges that require protocols for asset
   transfers and which SATP is well-suited to handle.  In the higher
   tier lie wholesale CBDC networks, bringing together central or
   reserve banks and various commercial banks.  Following the DeFi
   logic, these networks are typically built on distributed ledger and
   smart contract technologies.  Commercial banks hold reserve currency
   deposits with the reserve bank, which has the special power to mint
   currency and issue CBDC and also enforce regulatory compliance.  In
   the lower tier lie retail CBDC networks for commercial banks and
   their customers, built on similar technologies, enabling seamless,
   efficient, and transparent payments using CBDCs.  A retail CBDC
   network may involve a single commercial bank or multiple commercial
   banks, depending on the market caps of those banks and their purposes
   for joining such a network.

                               Figure 5

   Here we will encounter scenarios where a given commercial bank
   maintains digital currency accounts in a wholesale CBDC network as
   well as one or more retail CBDC networks.  To inject liquidity into a
   retail CBDC network, this bank will need to transfer currency from
   its reserve account in the wholesale CBDC network.  Or it may need to
   approve (or at least audit) the transfer of currency from one retail
   CBDC network to another bank in another retail CBDC network.  In the
   world of decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, currency cannot
   afford to remain siloed in any single CBDC network.  Hence, these
   networks must be interoperable in order to facilitate secure
   transfers of currency among themselves, as illustrated in Figure 5.

   We can identify two specific instances of currency transfer across
   networks in this example: one from a wholesale CBDC network to a
   retail CBDC network, and another from one retail CBDC network to
   another.  Since currency in tokenized form is a digital asset, these
   scenarios require the direct application of a secure protocol for
   asset transfer.  SATP [SATP] fits the bill, is agnostic of the types
   of distributed ledger technologies on which the respective networks
   are built, and simply requires the networks to use SATP gateways.
   This is not just a theoretical proposition; a candidate design for a
   bridge between Hyperledger Fabric [HLF] and Hyperledger Besu [HLB]
   networks using SATP and the Hyperledger Cacti interoperability
   platform [HLC] has been proposed by distributed ledger researchers
   [Aug23].

4.2.  Multi-CBDC Economy

   Several governments, banks and financial communities have explored
   the use of a shared ledger containing multiple CBDCs as way to
   potentially obtain an economy of scale in the development and
   maintenance of their own respective CBDCs.  Such a Multi-CBDC
   approach has the potential benefit to improve cross-border payments
   and protect monetary sovereignty, without necessarily becoming a
   monetary union [BISMCBDC].

   However, even within a Multi-CBDC configuration, there must be a
   mechanism to interconnect each respective national (sovereign) bank
   network with the shared Multi-CBDC network.  Gateways appear to be an
   attractive means to permit the transfer of a CBDC from one national
   network/ledger into the shared Multi-CBDC ledger, and vice versa.
   One major requirement is the assurance that consistency is maintained
   between the CBDC counts on the national network with that on the
   Multi-CBDC network (i.e. no counterfeiting; no double-spend).

   With or without a Multi-CBDC ledger, the existence of different
   national networks managing different wholesale CBDC assets will
   necessitate inter-network transfers for cross-border payments and
   settlements [BISCBP] [WBGCBP] [PUbin].  Whether directly between two
   wholesale CBDC networks or between a wholesale CBDC network and the
   Multi-CBDC network, transfer of currency assets is a problem for
   which SATP appears to be the most suitable solution.

4.3.  Delivery vs Payment (DvP) of Securities

   In Decentralized Finance, or DeFi for short, investors and financial
   institutions will form networks to manage the creation and purchase
   of securities.  As a simple example, we can consider a network
   consisting of the Treasury, which issues bonds, and commercial banks,
   which purchase and trade bonds.  We can also consider a payment
   network of the kind we saw in Section 3.3 (or a retail CBDC network
   of the kind we saw in Section 4.1), which allows CBDC transfers
   between commercial banks’ accounts.  In the securities network, banks
   may wish to transfer bonds to each other but only in exchange for
   compensation.  But such compensation can be made only on a payment
   network where the two maintain currency accounts (e.g., in CBDC).
   Therefore, the securities and payment networks must be able to
   interoperate in such a way that two banks can carry out a delivery-
   vs-payment transaction spanning these two independent networks.  Such
   a transaction must be atomic, i.e., either both bond and CBDC tokens
   get transferred in their respective networks or neither gets
   transferred.  Figure 6 illustrates this exchange.

                               Figure 6

   In a variation of this example, the two commercial banks may hold
   CBDC accounts in two different Payment Networks.  In that case,
   fulfilment of the DvP would require transfer of CBDC from one network
   to another.  An instance of SATP between gateways representing those
   two networks would handle that problem.

4.4.  Stock Options Contract Fulfilment

   Stock options are financial instruments that allow holders to buy or
   sell stock at predetermined prices until specific expiration dates
   [StOpt].  Exercising an option, i.e., buying or selling a stock by
   paying a “strike price”, involves a more complex cross-network
   financial transaction than the securities DvP use case.  Option
   contracts can be managed and enforced in a specific business network
   (which we can label as a “stock network”) to which entities like an
   Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), stock exchanges (e.g., the
   Chicago Board Options Exchange), and brokerage firms, belong.  The
   OCC is the issuer and guarantor for all options and futures contracts
   traded on U.S. exchanges [OCC].  It provides secured back-end
   clearing services, while exchanges provide front-end trading markets.
   Transfer and settlement of payments, just like in the DvP scenario,
   will typically occur in a dedicated payment network in which buyers
   and sellers of stock have currency accounts.  Options contract
   fulfilment requires the stock and payment networks to work in
   concert, and hence need SATP to coordinate transactions across them.

   Figure 7 illustrates a simplified flow for the exercising of a “call”
   option, where a buyer acquires stock from a seller by paying it a
   strike price.  First, the buyer informs its brokerage, which then
   notifies its exchange about the buyer's intent to exercise the
   option.  The exchange in turn notifies the OCC in the Stock Network.
   (All these notifications typically occur via a smart contract).
   Steps 1-2 illustrate these notifications.  The OCC then verifies the
   contract’s validity and the buyer’s right to exercise the option.  If
   this is successful, the OCC triggers a payment request to the buyer
   through a contract-to-contract communication from the Stock Network
   to the Payment Network (step 3).  (Alternatively, the buyer may
   trigger a payment request in the Payment Network, which then requests
   the Stock Network for proof of the contract’s validity from the OCC
   before approving the payment.)  The buyer then pays the strike price
   to the seller (step 4).  The payment receipt is now sent to the Stock
   Network for the OCC’s verification (or alternatively, the buyer can
   request the OCC to fetch and verify the receipt from the Payment
   Network) and fulfilment of the contract (step 5).  The OCC, via the
   exchange, requests the brokerage to transfer stock from the seller’s
   to the buyer’s account (steps 6-7).

   This cross-network transactions require SATP using gateways, either
   to communicate information of a contract’s validity (step 3) or a
   payment receipt (step 5) with authenticity proof (i.e., data
   sharing), or by ensuring that strike price payment (step 4) and
   contract fulfilment (step 6-7) occur atomically as an exchange using
   a coordinated set of commitments.

5.  Decentralized Commerce: Payments for Goods and Services

   In the emerging Web3 world, undergirded by blockchain and DLT, goods
   and services are increasingly available on decentralized networks,
   either as purely digital objects or proxies of physical objects.  The
   networks typically manage these assets in the form of non-fungible
   tokens (NFTs) using smart contracts and decentralized applications
   (DApps for short).  DeFi in a Web3 ecosystem can create thriving
   online marketplaces where goods and services can be bought and sold
   across network boundaries if those networks are interoperable (i.e.,
   assets and data can be moved or managed seamlessly across networks).
   SATP is a necessary requirement to enable and secure such a
   decentralized form of commerce.

5.1.  Transferal of Digital Art and Payments across National Borders

   There is currently growing interest within many artist communities of
   developing and selling digital-only artwork, in which the artwork
   consists of a file in a well-known (e.g., JPEG, MPEG) format that is
   created by an artist.  The artists seek to sell copies of the
   digital-only artwork on the global marketplace, allowing anyone in
   the world to purchase a copy and consume (e.g., display offline) the
   artwork at the buyer’s discretion.  Currently, the most popular
   technological vehicle to achieve this goal is through the
   tokenization of the copies of the artwork coupled with digital
   encryption/signature technologies to transfer control (and thereby
   legal ownership) of the digital-only artwork to the buyer.

   Although there are a number of technical and legal challenges (e.g.,
   copyright enforcement) to completing such a sale, one key issue
   pertains to the sale and payment for digital-only artwork across
   national borders.  Many nations enforce taxation upon the sale of any
   asset, including that of artwork generally both domestically and
   internationally.  Thus, when the control/ownership of a tokenized
   digital-only artwork is transferred to a new owner in a foreign
   nation and payment is received, taxation must be obtained at the
   point-of-sale (which could be an online platform) and proof of
   delivery must be traceable to ensure that no taxation-avoidance
   occurs.  A secure asset transfer protocol between systems that can be
   built on distributed or shared ledgers via gateways with designated
   legal authority is necessary to enforce governmental regulations and
   provide accountability.

5.2.  Payment for Streaming Services

   Streaming services like Netflix and IPTV can tap into the
   cryptocurrency and DeFi user markets by offering content on
   distributed ledger networks using smart contracts.  Instead of
   monthly subscriptions, they can offer pay-as-you-go streaming of
   arbitrarily low amounts to large numbers of users on such networks.
   Content transfer can be backed by NFTs, which users can redeem on any
   video or audio playback application.  Because here already exist
   several payment networks for unregulated (e.g., Bitcoin) and
   regulated (e.g., CBDC) currencies, the content networks are likely to
   remain independent and not involve any monetary transactions on their
   own ledgers, as that would create safety and regulatory issues.
   Content transfer in a content network can be backed by a
   corresponding payment in a payment network if there is a facility to
   transfer payment receipts from the latter to the former.  This can be
   fulfilled through the data sharing mode of SATP, whereby knowledge of
   payment along with authenticity proof can be communicated across
   networks.  Alternatively, an atomic swap of the content and the
   payment can occur across both networks using the asset exchange mode
   of SATP.

   In a related example, if users wish to obtain content that is not
   available currently with the streaming service provider, that
   provider may seek and purchase that content from another distributer
   that is offering it on a different content network.  The copyright to
   that content can be backed by NFTs and the secure transfer of those
   NFTs from one network to another will require SATP.

   Though these examples show what is possible, ongoing initiatives in
   Europe and China are aimed at facilitating data and asset transfers.
   Since 2022, China has issued a series of policies and guidelines to
   promote the development of a nationwide data market that supports
   data elements' assetization, capitalization, and circulation
   [CNMeas].  A multi-layered national data infrastructure is slated be
   built by the end of 2029 to support transaction, transmission, and
   utilization, of data; telecom operators like China Mobile and China
   Unicom are building large- scale networks to enable data transmission
   [CNDatInf].  Design and implementation of this infrastructure will be
   guided by the newly established National Data Standardization
   Technical Committee (TC609), which will coordinate with existing data
   circulation standards organizations like ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32 and ISO/
   IEC JTC 1/SC 42, and reuse existing standards.

   In Europe, several projects like Gaia-X [GaiaX] and Catena-X
   [CatenaX] aim to create secure, decentralized, and interoperable data
   infrastructures.  Catena-X specifically targets data exchanges in
   automotive industry operations while Gaia-X is a more generic, EU-
   wide data infrastructure.  The International Data Spaces Association
   (IDSA) produces several ISO standards like ISO/IEC AWI 20151 and ISO/
   IEC 23751:2022 for exchanges across data spaces [IDSA].  The IDSA
   also partners with the Eclipse Foundation to implement open-source
   solutions [EclDS] and jointly develop the Dataspace Protocol (DSP),
   using which data usage policies, usage contracts, and schemas can be
   negotiated (in the so-called "control plane") between two data-
   exchange gateway peers [DSP].  The actual post-negotiation data
   transfer (in the so-called "data plane") is out of scope of DSP, and
   here SATP can fill the gap.

6.  Trustworthy DNS Resource Record Migrations using an Augmented EPP

   We have seen several examples where SATP is indispensable for
   enabling cross-network asset and data transfer and transaction
   settlement.  But SATP can also be used to augment an existing
   protocol by making it more secure, trustworthy, and efficient rather
   than creating an altogether new feature that preexisting technology
   was unable to provide.  Conventional Internet architecture offers
   scope for such augmentation.  Though highly decentralized, the
   Internet consists of nodes (or actors) that play critical roles in
   various protocols.  Such protocols would benefit if the actions of
   these actors can be recorded and tracked on blockchain or other
   decentralized ledger networks.  (It must be noted that the
   performance implications of these augmentations ought to be studied
   before firm recommendations are made.)

   We consider the DNS architecture [RFC1034] [RFC1035], where multiple
   registries and registrars may co-exist, managing DNS records for
   owners (registrants).  For example, Verisign [VSign] acts as a TLD
   (top-level domain) registry for the “.com” namespace, and GoDaddy
   [GoDaddy] and Squarespace [SSpace] are registrars that can issue and
   sell SLDs (second- level domains) to customers (say Alice and Bob).
   The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) allows registrars to
   communicate with registries for resource record updates, including
   changes in domain ownership [RFC5730].  Consider a scenario in which
   Alice, who owns an SLD (say alice.com) issued by GoDaddy, wishes to
   transfer that SLD to Squarespace.  She can submit a request to
   Squarespace for this purpose, following which the respective
   registrars (GoDaddy and Squarespace) can communicate with the
   registry (Verisign) using EPP to transfer the SLD between themselves.
   Squarespace will then reissue the domain to Alice.  In a related
   scenario, Alice can transfer (or sell) her GoDaddy-issued domain to
   Bob, who uses Squarespace as a registrant.

   Though EPP facilitates these resource updates and transfers, and
   reputed registrars offer customers these features in a usable manner,
   we can see that such scenarios face safety issues as they require
   trust and proper coordination among the participants.  These issues
   can be mitigated by distributed ledger networks, smart contracts, and
   NFTs, which collectively provide a platform for safe and transparent
   DNS resource transfers with easy detection of non-compliance.

   In such a scheme, domains (or domain names) can be monetized as NFTs
   or digital assets, e.g., in the form of ERC-721 [ERC721] tokens, a
   popular NFT standard in the Ethereum ecosystem [Ethereum].  The
   creation of a domain is represented by minting of an NFT and the
   deletion of a domain by the burning of the NFT using smart contracts
   whose transactions are tracked on a distributed ledger maintained by
   a network of entities.  Registrants Alice and Bob also participate in
   the smart contracts and hold wallet identities, allowing them to
   trade assets by submitting transactions to the ledger.  Registrants,
   registrars, and registries can engage in commercial transactions
   using contracts governing tokenized (and monetized) domains for the
   purposes of issuing and transferring domains (among owners and
   registrars).  This provides more safety where registrars are not
   reputed, and allows new registrar services to emerge and build
   reputations.  It also enables customers like Alice and Bob to sell
   domains to each other safely and seamlessly.

   SATP is crucial to enabling this scheme where registrars belong to,
   and issue, NFT-backed domains in different ledgers maintained by
   different networks.  Ensuring that tokens are securely and atomically
   transferred between the ledgers will be a necessary prerequisite for
   an EPP resource record update operation.  Further, non-compliance, or
   non-fulfilment of EPP, by either registrar, can be easily detected by
   examining the SATP logs from the respective networks’ gateways,
   thereby safeguarding the process.  In future, reputed registrars may
   require their counterparties to comply with SATP-based transfers
   across ledgers as a prerequisite to engaging in a domain transfer
   with them.

   This scenario additionally illustrates an example of what typically
   occurs in Stage 0 of a SATP instance [SATP], which is where
   negotiation and agreement-building occurs between gateways.  EPP
   instances among registrars and registries will occur in this stage,
   both prior to the start of an SATP instance and after its conclusion.
   EPP will produce the transaction context the gateways need to
   transfer an asset (in this case, a tokenized domain) using SATP.
   Many other applications of SATP for asset transfers may similarly
   augment or bolster pre-existing business workflows, which (like EPP
   here) will produce transactions contexts for SATP instances.

7.  Interoperation Protocol Considerations

   The use cases provided as examples serve to illustrate instances of
   general phenomena that the Secure Asset Transfer Protocol [SATP],
   with a limited number of variations, is designed to handle.  The data
   sharing examples in Section 3 can be extrapolated to any kinds of
   data that need to be shared between networks running arbitrary
   workflows.  The asset transfer example in Section 4.1 and the asset
   exchange example in Section 4.3 similarly can be extrapolated to any
   kinds of digital assets lying within any kind of network.
   Considerations for the interoperability protocol, or SATP, can
   therefore be limited to standard distributed systems issues like
   integrity, fault tolerance, and liveness, while completely
   disregarding the nature of the assets, networks, and workflows, which
   can all remain opaque to the protocol.
